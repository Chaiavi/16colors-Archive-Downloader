# 16colors-Archive-Downloader
Downloader for the whole [Sixteen Colors Archive](https://github.com/sixteencolors/sixteencolors-archive)
  
The need for this downloader comes from the fact that the Sixteen Colors (ANSI) Archive is huge (more than 3gb).  
thus is complicated to download in some systems.  
  
This downloader is a robust downloader which has "Resume" functionality and nice logs :-)  so the user will be able to download all of the archive with a fail safe mechanism so if the download fails he will be able to resume the download at a later stage.
